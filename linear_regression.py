#correlation matrix
#1.0: perfect positive correlation; that is, when one attribute rises, the other attribute rises.
#-1.0: perfect negative correlation; that is, when one attribute rises, the other attribute falls.
#0.0: no correlation; the two columns are not linearly related.

#Answers about correlation metrics 

# Which feature correlates most strongly to the label FARE?
# ---------------------------------------------------------
answer = '''
The feature with the strongest correlation to the FARE is TRIP_MILES.
As you might expect, TRIP_MILES looks like a good feature to start with to train
the model. Also, notice that the feature TRIP_SECONDS has a strong correlation
with fare too.
